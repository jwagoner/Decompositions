--numericalCumulants.py contains code that should be useful for a 
	number of numerical tests
--cbr.py is my test of CBR

--cbr.py is a bit of a mess, but the best way to get a hold on what's
	happening is to look at getCBRenergies() and play around
	with the mu/sigma arrays for the two states.  
--in main() of cbr.py, there are two output lines starting with "C4"
	and "C2".  These output comparisons of \Delta \Delta A
	and \Delta A^* for the two components 
--Based on all relevant complications of CBR, it's possible that
	this numerical test is useless and doesn't capture the
	reality of a binding process.  There are many variables to be 
	considered

--cumulant_base.py contains all relevant functions
--basic_proof.py can be run to show that all higher order terms
	disapper (analagous to eqn. 18 in the current version of the manuscript)
-- the relevant output of basic_proof.py is the "COMBINED i" lines, which 
	give all the remaining cumulants of order i.  These cumulants
	are given in a code form that is described in cumulant_base.py. 
	A blank line means all cumulants of that order have been 
	cancelled.  Run basic_proof.py as-is to see the proof up
	to order 4.
